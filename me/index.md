In my professional life I'm a security researcher and OSS contributor. I post mostly on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ilyaglotov). You can reach me by [email](mailto:ilya@ilyaglotov.com), here is my [PGP key](https://keybase.io/ilyaglotov/pgp_keys.asc).

Besides that I love to dig [new artists](https://glowmagnetic.tumblr.com) and [music](https://soundcloud.com/ilya-glotov), take [shots on my phone and olympus mju-ii](https://www.instagram.com/ilyaglow). Of course I have a [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ilyaglotov) and [vk](https://vk.com/ilyaglow).
