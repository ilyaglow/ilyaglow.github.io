I do threat analysis, security research and engineering that follows it in a
security operation center.
I'm a huge fan of [opensource](https://github.com/ilyaglow).

I post mostly on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ilyaglotov).

You can reach me by [email](mailto:ilya@ilyaglotov.com),
here is my [PGP key](https://keybase.io/ilyaglotov/pgp_keys.asc).
I'm fine with [keybase](https://keybase.io/ilyaglotov) too.
