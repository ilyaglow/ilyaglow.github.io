I do security engineering and automation, threat analysis and research â€“ both
defensive and offensive side.
I'm a huge fan of [opensource](https://github.com/ilyaglow).

I post mostly on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ilyaglow).

You can reach me by [email](mailto:contact+web@ilya.app),

I'm fine with [keybase](https://keybase.io/ilyaglotov) too.
