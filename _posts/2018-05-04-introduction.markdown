I started to think about a blog for a couple years now and even wrote few articles but sadly never published anything. Honestly, I never had a time to do it right, proofread and polish posts and stuff, so suddenly the topic I had covered became irrelevant and started to bore me...

So I decided that this blog will be used mainly for a quick notes on different topics, that I face during my work as an incident responder / penetration tester / security tools coder.

Eventually, longreads may appear here too. Probably even in _russian_.

Hope some notes will be helpful for someone and we all have fun.

Stay tuned.
